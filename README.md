# Shirt Catalog

A project create as a take home project for an interview


## Lessons Learned

I practiced clean architecture and loose coupling, working with the multiple layers of the onion architecture, handled images, used EF Core with code-first approach, etc.

TODO: There are many parts of the front end that I need to refactor with a better solution when I have more time to improve the code.

# Features

- List, add, and remove images for shirt variations, such as the combination of color and fabric type for the shirt.
